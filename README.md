A project carried out to quantify the risk posed to humanity by a series of Near-Earth Asteroids (NEAs) using observations taken over the course of January 2024 - March 2024. The NEAs investigated in this work were 1998 XB, 2001 QQ142, 1991 AQ, and Toro, alongside a single main-belt asteroid, Dembowska.

The find_orb Orbit Determination software (Gray, B. (2022) Find Orb Orbit Determination Software. ADSBibcode: 2022ascl.soft02016G) was integrated alongside the Jupyter notebooks and Python scripts in this repository to determine the orbital elements of each NEA and propagate their orbits forward in time to investigate any future close approach events.

The final report, which details the background theory, methodology, results, and conclusions for the project, is also included in this repository as a pdf.
